## **☁️ Hey there, I’m Anaum ☁️**
I'm a second-year bachelor's student and a full-time AI engineer who is focused on building AI systems that actually work in real-world production environments. I have a particular liking for tasks involving AI agents and reinforcement learning. If you're interested in collaborating, sharing ideas, or just having a chat, feel free to reach out via X, email or LinkedIn!
