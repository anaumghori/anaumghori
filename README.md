##  <img src="images/wave_emoji.gif" width="25"> Hello, I'm Anaum Ghori!
(The “u” is silent, it’s really just “Anam.” But you can call me **Mir**, too.)  

I'm a second-year Bachelor of Computer Applications student who enjoys working on frontier problems. My broad interest lies in artificial intelligence, with most of my work revolving around deep learning. I especially enjoy tackling multimodal problems (audio, speech, text, vision… throw anything at me). Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into reinforcement learning, both theoretically and practically.

I have a genuine love for reading research papers and re-implementing the ones I find interesting. Right now, I’m practicing how to write one myself, from doing original research to designing experiments and exploring new approaches. One of my short-term goals is to publish a research paper, so if you're ever working on one, you know who to hit up as a co-author ;) My other technical interest is in Robotics. I don’t have hands-on experience yet, but I’ve been gradually building my understanding and learning more about the field.

### Experience

I'm currently working full-time as an AI Engineer at [SparkAI](https://www.trysparkai.com/), where I design end-to-end AI products for real-world use cases. I've also taken on a few freelancing projects in the past, and I'm still open to more if you’ve got something interesting in mind.

While I enjoy building practical AI systems, I’m especially drawn to research-oriented roles, where I can contribute more directly to the field and push boundaries. I’m always open to opportunities in that direction.
